Benefits of using remote repository
 - Using a remote repository such as GitHub allows you to share your code with others so that they can also use it and edit it for their 
own purposes. It follows the theme of open source that Git follows and as a result, others have the ability to make contributions 
to your own code as well. Keeping your work local is ideal for a private project but in the real business world, it is common practice
to use open source. 

Push, Pull, Remote 
 - Push = local repo -> public GitHub repo . . . git push (remote) master
 - Pull = public GitHub repo -> local repo . . . git pull (remote) master
 *always better practice to manually pull instead of letting Git automatically 
  stay up-to-date with your remote repository
 - Remote is used when you want to connect your local repo with online repo 
first create a new remote -> git remote add (name) url of repository

Git Fork 
 - Allows you to copy a repository from another user onto your GitHub account. Without git fork, you would have to first clone the other persons repo onto your computer. Then create 
a new repo from your computer and then commit that repo onto GitHub. However, Forking does NOT allow you edit the original version of repo. Forking also ALWAYS points back 
to the original and allows you to see the commits the user has made
 - Git Fork button available on GitHub only (no command for it) 
 - After forking, It is good practice to edit your file on your computer as oppopsed to GitHub.
