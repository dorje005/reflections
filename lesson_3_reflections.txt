Benefits of using remote repository
 - Using a remote repository such as GitHub allows you to share your code with others so that they can also use it and edit it for their 
own purposes. It follows the theme of open source that Git follows and as a result, others have the ability to make contributions 
to your own code as well. Keeping your work local is ideal for a private project but in the real business world, it is common practice
to use open source.
